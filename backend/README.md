# MyPortfolioLandingPage Backend

A secure ASP.NET Core backend API designed with security-first principles and end-to-end encryption.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Development HTTPS certificate

### Setup Development Certificate
```bash
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

### Run the Application

**Development Mode** (with OpenAPI/Swagger):
```bash
dotnet run --launch-profile Development
```
Access OpenAPI at: https://localhost:5000/openapi

**Production Mode** (default, secure):
```bash
dotnet run --launch-profile Production
# or simply
dotnet run
```

### Test the API
```bash
curl -k https://localhost:5000/health
```

## Security Features

- üîí **HTTPS-Only**: End-to-end encryption, no HTTP endpoints
- üè† **Localhost-Only**: Hardcoded binding to 127.0.0.1
- üöÄ **Production by Default**: Secure unless explicitly set to Development
- üîê **Reverse Proxy Ready**: Designed for nginx/Apache/IIS frontend
- üõ°Ô∏è **Minimal Attack Surface**: No external access possible

## Architecture

```

         External SSL               Internal SSL
         Certificate                Dev/Prod Certificate
```

## Configuration

Edit `appsettings.json` to change the HTTPS port:
```json
{
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "Https": {
        "Port": 5000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Default Production Mode

The Production launch profile intentionally has **no environment variable set** to verify that the application defaults to Production mode. This is a security test to ensure "secure by default" behavior.

## Documentation

- [Security Architecture](./SECURITY.md) - Detailed security documentation
- [Test Endpoints](./test.http) - REST client test file

## Important Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è This API **cannot** be accessed from outside the machine - this is by design!  
‚ö†Ô∏è All external access must go through a properly configured reverse proxy  
‚ö†Ô∏è The localhost binding is hardcoded and cannot be changed via configuration
